_Shiny Applcation_ in R.

## Goal

<div style="text-align: justify">

> Develop an [application](https://alexisvte.shinyapps.io/big-data-app/?_ga=2.183157155.462710402.1681053594-1612834766.1681053594) to show some knowledge and skills in R.

- diseases analysis depending on three datasets:
  - GDP,
  - CO2,
  - Pop.

## Documentation

The purpose of the application is to offer some statistical methods to analyze the death rate of several pollution-related diseases based on UN and WHO datasets.

We have a `shiny` application that we call on RStudio or by typing:

```r
runApp("app")
```

```bash
.
├── .gitignore
├── .Rbuildignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
│   └── hello.R
├── exampleRPackage.Rproj
└── man
    └── hello.Rd
```

The purpose of the application is to offer the user a way to see the portfolio value evolution in direct according to customers caracteristics, revenue, cost and discount rate.

The user can, if he wishes, visualize all the data including diseases, GDP, C02 and Pop needed by the application.

### Result:

![Shiny for R application.](https://github.com/alexisvte/bd-m2/assets/82931295/97117db8-06fb-4194-aa0c-437be47e05c1)
